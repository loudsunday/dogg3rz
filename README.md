# dogg3rz
An open source decentralized distributed healthcare ecosystem(DDHE) framework for metadata managing and cataloging project. Pronounced “doggers”.

The Dogg3rz framework is a set of open source protocols & primitives that utilize emerging and existing open source technology like IPFS and open metadata prototcols to: 
 - Enable members to define, build, manage and register an "end to end" repo that include all the components for running an implementation 
 - Enable consumers a "Catalog of implementations" to select and run on their environments

The Dogg3rz repos can contain metalanguage definitions and services like; data, data models, services, relationships and integration flows for a complete implementation. 

The functional components for the repos can be grouped by but not limited to; data management, contract management, catalog management, containerization, runtime environment management, fetch, aggregate, curate, analyze and presention.
