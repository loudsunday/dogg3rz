Bringing parity to the dichotomy of logic and metadata, this is an open source metadata management platform that is decentralized, has zero barriers to participation, allows for multiple ‘perspectives’ of metadata but also allows for self-selecting groups to achieve consensus that may produce de-facto metadata standards. Pronounced “doggers” named after the founder's Rhodesian Ridgeback.

At the moment, we see some obvious affinities with the IPFS project with its ability to create immutable, globally referenceable linked data structures. As well as possibly using Ethereum as a consensus engine. As with any open source project, the implementation and tooling may evolve but the overarching mission to ‘scratch an itch’ will remain. Stay tuned…
